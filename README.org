* SoapyRX

An SDR receiver built on [[https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR/wiki][SoapySDR]].

The scope of this tool is to handle signal acquisition from an SDR. Using
SoapySDR as backend, it supports every SDR supported by the latter -- as long
as the corresponding module is installed. It not meant to process datasets of
signals (/e.g./, conversion, alignment, normalization).

- Features ::
  - Record from multiple SDRs in parallel.
  - Display basic signal visualization (amplitude, phase rotation, time-domain, frequency-domain).
  - Perform single-signal operations (/e.g./, interactive cutting).
  - Use complex numbers (I/Q) for storage (=numpy.complex64=).

* Installation

1. Install [[https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR/wiki][SoapySDR]] using distribution packages or sources.
