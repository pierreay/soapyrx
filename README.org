* SoapyRX

An SDR receiver built on [[https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR/wiki][SoapySDR]].

The scope of this tool is to handle signal acquisition from an SDR. Using
SoapySDR as backend, it supports every SDR supported by the latter -- as long
as the corresponding module is installed. SoapyRX can record from multiple SDRs
in parallel, display basic signal visualization, as well as perform
single-signal operations (/e.g./, conversion, cut). It not meant to process
datasets (/e.g./, alignment, normalization).
